Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

    I honestly was continuously surprised by the "power of functions" The very first couple of group projects I was amazed that one I was able to actully program with functions.
    Two They were so usable, I could make functions that could be used for various operations and used repeatedly in one program.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

    Functions make coding what it is today, without functions we could not have programs that preform numerous things. Functions make code reusable and dynamic I think.
    They also really help to organize our code. They help us keep our code straight and structured in an understandable way and user friendly way.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    I am rather poor troubleshooting skills still. I tend to rush through the code for sure so I can confidently say I know one thing I can do that would help greatly with improving my skill in troubleshooting.
    Read, and read slower and work to understand by taking the time necessary to understand what is being read so I don't have to test the code with little understanding of it and have to go back and read it all again.
    I end up wasting so much time that way. As I was saying I rush through it. I think I need to be more patient with the reading to then be more thoughtful about how I can trouble shoot the code, I generally just rush in blind.
    Of course that is a really bad way to go about things so I need to chang that without a doubt.
